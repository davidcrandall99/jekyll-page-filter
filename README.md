# jekyll-page-filter
Filter through jekyll.rb pages and display them how you want with AngularJS

This small app assumes the following:

1. You have an installation of Jekyll.rb running
2. Your pages have a layout called productPages - though you can replace this with whatever you want
3. There is an option to sort by date, in which case you would need to assign a date variable to the jekyll header as well.

NOTE: I pulled this and minified this script from another project. If you spot bugs, or have any improvemetns, feel free to fork and contribute.

TO USE THIS:
Simply drop it into your jekyll site, making sure the above three statements are true, or modify the variables and functions to match your current setup.
